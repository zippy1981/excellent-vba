# Excellent VBA

Go Additions for VBA

## What is it?

A VBA Adding and a golang DLL that gives you macros with the power of GO

Also some VB.NET

## Why?

**Short answer:** Because I'm weird.

**Long version:** I am a college drop out that taught myself linux, became a third shift IBM iSeries (now IBM i originally AS/400) operator then did php development and unix administration before mainly becoming a dotner developer. Aong that time I tried to do C as a hobby, and I akso did things with VBA macros in Excel. Fastforward to 2021 my boss starts a go study group. I discovgit er how to make DLLs with go. I decide to do something truely weird with it.

## What does it do?

Right now its just macros for generating GUIDs in excel. It's not the most useful thing. I'll add more useful things as I go.

## Building the dll

`go build  -o excellent-vba.dll`
